I've always wanted a blog but I never thought I deserved one.

That says something, doesn't it.

Today, at least that's something I can change.

I love writing about everything and nothing. I'd love for my children to one day read my musings and gain just a little bit of insight into who I am (or was).

It has been a rough year. After being married for 13 years I asked my wife for a divorce. Even though I still think it was the right thing to do it was by far the hardest decision I've ever had to make in my life. Our 3 children are still adjusting to the new normal and I'm ... well, I'm still adjusting too.

With that said, I'm excited for the future. I'm a firm believer in constantly improving, and I have a lot of improvement to do.

If if you enjoy any of my posts, please let me know. I'd love to hear from you.
